=====

Dump issues for a Github repository into a single markdown file. 

There are various other projects that handle Github issue exports
(Eg. [offline-issues](https://github.com/jlord/offline-issues)), but I couldn't
find one that writes all issues, comments and metadata to a single readable
file.


Example exports
---------------

An example exported file is included in the [examples directory](./examples/sshrc.md)
