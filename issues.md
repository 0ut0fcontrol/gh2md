For anybody reading this years later: I finally did some work on this project again. By default it will now fetch all issues + PRs, and you can selectively disabled the parts you don't want using some new flags, eg. `--no-closed-prs`.

I actually think closed issues should have always worked, but closed PRs did not.

See the help text or README for more details.

# [\#3 PR](https://github.com/mattduck/gh2md/pull/3) `closed`: Config file for pyup.io

#### <img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16239342?v=4" width="50">[pyup.io bot](https://github.com/pyup-bot) opened issue at [2017-05-21 12:59](https://github.com/mattduck/gh2md/pull/3):

Hi there and thanks for using pyup.io!

Since you are using a non-default config I've created one for you.

There are a lot of things you can configure on top of that, so make sure to check out the [docs](https://pyup.io/docs/configuration/) to see what I can do for you.

I'm making an issue just so I can run this tool against its own repository.
